This code constructs the dp table by iterating over all pairs of indices in a and b, filling in the lengths of their LCSs. 
It then walks back from dp[m][n] to dp[0][0], reconstructing the actual sequence of the LCS by checking whether the length came from a match (and therefore including that element in the LCS) or from skipping an element in one of the sequences. 
Finally, because the reconstruction starts from the end of the sequences and works backward, the resulting list is reversed before being returned.
